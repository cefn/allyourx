Chanel (game audio designer): linked me to Wwise and FMod audio gaming engines. From Wwise introductory guide - another decoupled collaboration between 'design' stakeholders and programmer implementors.
The sound designer is responsible for:
• Creating audio hierarchies and behaviors.
• Creating audio events.
• Integrating audio events into your world building application.
• Setting sound properties and sources.
• Defining sound positioning (3D).
• Determining audio signal routing and mixing aspects for all sounds.
• Assigning real time parameter controls and game states.
• Defining effect property sets for the various environments in your game.
• Defining volume and LPF obstruction and occlusion properties.
• Creating and optimizing SoundBanks.
• Customizing multiple platforms.
• Performing language localization.
