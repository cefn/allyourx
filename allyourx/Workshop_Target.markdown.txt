Non-programmers will be invited to workshops where the device domain, behaviour design task and toolset will be disclosed.

During the session, the toolset has to...
* Present a domain-specific language authoring environment in which authored behaviours and authoring steps are comprehensible to non-programmers.
* Enable real-time compilation and deployment to a target environment
* Capture informally shared ‘programs’ in an “abstract syntax tree structure”, even when the program is not valid in the domain specific language.
* Maintain a backlog of actions needed to make invalid AST structures deployable, that is, made valid, bound to target code, compiled and executed on the demonstration device.
