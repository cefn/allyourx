                  <p>
                     AllyourX is a minimal standard defining the rich data which an application requests from its users.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     GPL software is provided which uses this information to automatically generate a functional front end for your users, 
                     as well as defining the back-end interaction with your choice of hosting platform.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     The standard is agnostic to specific hosting technologies used, allowing prototyping to proceed without committing to database
                     or server technologies.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <h1><a name="2">How does it relate to existing standards and software ?</a></h1>
                  
                  <p>
                     The AllyourX toolset is merely a smart combination of selected <a href="standard.html">standards</a> and <a href="software.html">software</a>.
                     It extends them minimally, and only to the extent which is absolutely necessary to close the gap between schema languages
                     and fully working 
                     applications.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <h1><a name="3">What are the benefits of conforming?</a></h1>
                  
                  <p>
                     You should be able to prototype applications without writing much, if any, application code.
                     A GPL software implementation is available which generates forms for your users in XHTML (webpages in the browser) 
                     and outputs data to store in the form of XML.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Once you additionally define queries and views on your data, (we choose XPath and XQuery for this), this fully defines most
                     web applications. 
                     You can rapidly prototype your app using the canonical XHTML+javascript+XML implementations provided, and 
                     later specialise your choice of look and feel, implementation language, data storage and query engine according to your 
                     tastes and needs, rather than being locked into one implementation approach for the lifetime of your app. 
                     This contrasts with typical apps which tangle the definition of form validation, front-end and 
                     back-end together with host-specific and language-specific implementation details.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     A canonical example of a single-user application is provided, which runs as a Firefox plugin, stores your rich data 
                     on your local disk and uses XQuery to query and construct views (pages) on the fly. This application can be re-purposed 
                     to the creation of almost any single-user website by simply copy-pasting your design in place. However, the same techniques
                     
                     can be applied to multi-user web applications. If you're inspired by the single user prototype, we are 
                     <a href="http://allyourx.co.uk/contact.html">here to help.</a>. Storage and querying are separate modules from the data 
                     authoring framework, so we hope to see a community of people specialising these techniques for their favourite hosting flavour
                     too.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <h1><a name="4">What software supports the standard ?</a></h1>
                  
                  <p>                
                     A single-user canonical implementation already exists suitable to generate websites hosted on your local 
                     machine. The user interface is browser-based, using an XHTML+JQuery (front end), local XML file storage (back end) 
                     and POW+XQuery hosting (server and query engine). It is available <a href="software.html#allyourx.co.uk">here</a>.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Multi-user applications can take advantage of <a href="contribute.html">a variety of hosting and querying platforms</a> 
                     with more to follow.

                  <p>
                     We believe that maximising benefit to users is simply a good way of doing business. With this single-minded focus
                     we hope to reach millions of users by removing blatantly obvious obstacles to application prototyping which 
                     currently make users unhappy.                 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Doing it for free helps us to focus on customer enablement, rather than customer prevention. 
                     The mainstream industry is in the business of prevention, through licensing and lock-in. It overlooks these trivial 
                     early-lifecycle prototyping problems in the interests of selling monolithic and expensive solutions where they are unnecessary.

                     It's a combination of "<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/21/messages/46.html">All your eggs in one basket</a>", 
                     and "<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/02/22/all_your_base_are_belong/">All your base are belong to us</a>", 
                     two important proverbs from the English language.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     You can avoid putting all your eggs in one basket by adopting a standard which can bridge a host of
                     front-end and back-end technologies, making migration to a new hosting technology simple as your needs change.
